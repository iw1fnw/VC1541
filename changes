				 CHANGES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.04pl6:
	* fixed the XE1541 cable detection code
	* fixed a bug where temporary files were not deleted (thanks to Tibor
	  Biczo for pointing this out)
	* added directory reloading after saving a file; only implemented
	  for DOS and .D64; can't save to other filesystems anyway ;-)
	* some small compile fixes for newer gcc versions (tested under
	  linux with egcs 1.0.3; may work for gcc 2.8 too :)
	* added a small patch (file "patch.tv") for compiling tvision-0.6
	  (again linux with egcs 1.0.3; for DOS I still use gcc 2.7.2.1)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.04pl5:
	* LOAD"*",8 now loads the highlighted file
	* changed directory loading again:
	  - LOAD"$X",8 and LOAD"$X*",8 behave like on the real floppy now
	  - implicit changing directories is still possible but needs
	    two '$' to distinguish from original directory loading
	    (e.g. LOAD"$$X",8 changes into directory X and loads the
	    content, LOAD"$$..",8 goes up one level) [I'm quite open for
	    better ideas :-]
	* disabled option -mhz when not using the timestamp counter, added
	  option -speed that should be used in this case
	* changed calibration loop when using timestamp counter to use
	  timer irq instead of sleep(); it's much faster now
	* added support for the XE1541 cable; new port and cable detection
	  code (kindly donated by Wolfgang Moser again, thanks)
	* NOTE: detecting the XE1541 cable only works if the C64 is
	  switched on!
	* commandline parsing didn't recognize missing arguments if an
	  option that needs arguments was the last one, fixed
	* added option -cable to specify the cable type; it has to be
	  used together with -lpt when the detection of a XE1541 cable
	  failed (because the default is X1541); this option has no effect
	  when a detected cable is used
	* removed the IECINFO program from the binary distribution

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.04pl4:
	* support for .ZIP files with internal directories
	* new timing code that allows the emulator to run on non pentium
	  machines again (currently only tested on my 486DX4/100 but may
	  even run on slower machines)
	* added a directory tree viewer 'cause I got lost on my harddisk
	  without it ;-)
	* changing directory is now possible from the c64 side again; you
	  can go into directory <dir> with LOAD"$<dir>",8
	* bugfix for LOAD"X",8 with X being a directory; does not crash
	  anymore but goes into directory X and sends the listing

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.04pl3:
	* new commandline switch:
		-dir directory
	  this tells the emulator to go to this directory at startup
	  (e.g. -dir C:\TMP\DATA\DISKS.ZIP\DISK1.D64 and yes, this
	  disks.zip is a ZIP-archive!)
	  for now dos pathnames _must_ be given in upper case :-(
	* limited and untested support for reading disk sectors with
		10 OPEN15,8,15
		20 OPEN2,8,2,"#"
		30 PRINT#15,"U1:2 0 18 0"
		   ...
	* for all non disk image formats there is now a directory track
	  emulation available that should allow c64 programs to read the
	  directory directly via sector read starting at 18/1
	* added a sector viewer for .d64 disk images (and the directory
	  sector emulation)
	* started to implement save support, for now it works only when
	  saving directly to a DOS file or to an attached .d64 disk image
	* command channel support improved, it's now possible to read
	  the floppy error channel with:
		10 OPEN1,8,15
		20 GET#1,A$
		30 PRINTA$;
		40 GOTO20
	* a new program called IECINFO is now available, this allows
	  to display the protocol between C64 and a real floppy;
	  it's mainly there for debugging but it may help if the
	  emulator does not work

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.04pl2:
	* directory listing are sorted now
	* fixed _lots_ of memory leaks and some other memory related bugs
	* thanks go to Armin Biere for his really useful ccmalloc V0.2
	  that saved much time when searching for memory leaks

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.04pl1:
	* added commandline switches:
		-lpt 1..4
		-mhz 33..1000 :-)
	  to override the automagically probed values
	* fixed the debug output stream, it is now implemented as showed in
	  the info file for libio (part of glib++), reading manuals is
	  sometimes really useful ;-)
          
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.04:
	* like V0.03pl4 this is a pentium version only!
	* around 90 percent rewritten
	* now using C++, compiles with DJGPP/ GNU gcc
	* unlimited recursive file read operations (well, limited by harddisk
          space)
	* it's possible to look into gzipped files or achives created by
	  PkZip (needs unzip386.exe), Arj and Lha
	* incomplete ZipCode support (works only if the files are directly
	  stored on disk)
	* added a simple user interface (based on Robert H”hnes Unix/DJGPP
	  port of Borland Turbo Vision), mouse support is a bit limited but
          it works great with the keyboard ;-)
	* added parallel port detection code provided by Wolfgang Moser

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.03pl4:
	* special release for computers with fast processor (pentium and
	  above)
		- uses model specific register for timing (time stamp counter)
		- may hang if an older EMM386 is installed (because the
		  EMM386 must emulate the rdmsr instruction!)
	* works on my new AMD-K6 and should run on Intel pentium and
	  pentium pro, may run on Cyrix processors
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.03pl3:
	* added some .T64 magic strings; recognized are now:
		- "C64 tape file"
		- "C64 tape image file"
		- "C64S tape file"
		- "C64S tape image file"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.03pl2:
	* changed timing functions again, now it works on a DECstation 300
	  (which is a _really_ slow 386sx/16)
	* added -dump switch that enables screen dump on exit (saves into
	  'screen.txt')
	* commented out the waiting for ATN line zero on close commands again
	  (I have no idea what's the reason for this timeout errors)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.03pl1:
	* fixed for use with monochrome displays
	* fixed port reading (waits till two sequential reads give the
	  same value)
	* optimized timing, now it runs even on my old 386sx/25 ;-)
	* added a screensaver
	* rudimentary command channel support, this is very unstable
	  but it allows directory listing with my Action Replay Cardridge
	  (if you have such a cardridge too, disable the floppy speeder
	  with the 'OFF' command and you can load files with the function
	  keys)
	* added int 0x24 handler to get rid of those annoying dos messages
	  if a device is not ready (i.e. A: without a floppy)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.03:
        * added loader for LYNX archives (.LNX)
        * not very much tested (lacking different types of archives)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.02:
        * completely rewrote the protocol handling routines
          (after checking the 1541 ROM listing)
        * timeout for all routines implemented, so no reset button
          needed anymore
        * saving disabled
        * 1.5 times faster than the real floppy
          loading 197 blocks takes 87 seconds instead of 132 seconds
        * can be used together with a real floppy
          (i.e. real floppy as device 8 and emulator as 9 to 11)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.01:
        * first attempt to emulate the c64 serial protocol for
          use in a floppy emulator
        * lots of timing problems
        * need to press the reset button after protocol errors :-(
        * loaders for
          - filesystem
          - tape images (.T64)
          - disk images (.D64)
